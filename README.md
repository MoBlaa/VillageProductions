# Minecraft VillageProduction Mod

## Description

As Mods added ME Systems and other automation modifications to Minecraft things got technical very fast. This mod aims to integrate automation and management techniques into the villager system of Vanilla Minecraft (state 1.14.*).

Goals will emerge with development but currently some ideas are present:

- Add a "Whiteboard" to a village to manage its resources. (Management Block)
- Passive Harvesting of resources through present villagers and their jobs or blocks present in the village. (depends on ease of implementation)
- Autocrafting with available resources. (Autocrafting something should take some time)

As a village grows it's very important to keep the villagers save from pillagers and other threats. You have to take care of the amount of chests available in town, build a warehouse, a sheep farm and everything and in exchange the villagers will harvest and craft resources for you.

## Development Information

This mod is developed with the fabric template project on github. Currently this project is a single man project. Contributions are allowed but as it's a hobby you may open your own project and build it your way, i won't mind. As long as the functionality is someday implemented.
